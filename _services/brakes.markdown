On a scale of 1 to 10, the importance of properly working brakes is at the top of the list for most drivers.  Periodic inspection, repair and adjustment is required to ensure safe handling and stopping-especially with unexpected lock downs.  Driver safety is a high priority for our shop, beside the fact that our families and friends are on the roads as well.
