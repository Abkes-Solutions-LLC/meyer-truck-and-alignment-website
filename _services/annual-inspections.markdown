When you have an annual safety inspection performed at Meyer Truck & Alignment you can be certain it will be done correctly by our Certified Technicians.  When we inspect your semi trailer it also doubles as your service interval.  We grease the brake components and landing gear, free up and lube your brake yolk pins, check hub oil levels, adjust the brakes and thump your tires, and of course-check & repair your lights. We offer these inspections on semi tractors, semi trailer, and trucks.
