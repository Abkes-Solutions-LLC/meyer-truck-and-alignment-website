Meyer Truck & Alignment, Inc was started by Chris Meyer and his wife, Terri, on their farm near Iowa Falls, Iowa in 1991 as an Ag equipment repair shop. The company started as a sole proprietership and officially incorporated in April of 2005. With a change of vision, the owners realized that the trucking industry seemed more stable and profitable, thereby allowing them to be in a position to provide for their family and church.
